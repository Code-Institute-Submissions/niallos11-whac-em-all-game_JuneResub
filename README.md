The site will be targeted toward people who not only love to implement more advanced JavaScript concepts but also maths. Love Maths is a fully responsive JavaScript maths game that will allow users to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.

This game is based on the popular game in the 1980s whac-em-all or somtimes call whack a mole game. This idea is to hit as  moles that pop in the main game area.
Each time you hit a mole you get a point, the more times you hit the target the more points you can get.
